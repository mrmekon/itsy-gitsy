This example renders a few git repositories as an mdBook with Itsy-Gitsy.

You'll need to have Itsy-Gitsy and mdbook available.  Update the
commands below to use absolute paths, if necessary.

Build the book with:

$ itsy-gitsy -c mdbook.toml --clean --local
$ mdbook serve rendered/

And navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view.  That's it!
